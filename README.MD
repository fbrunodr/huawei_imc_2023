# Solving Huawei IMC stand challenges
See the image in this repository.
In short, Huawei is the main sponsor of the 30th IMC (https://imc-math.org.uk/).


They have a stand where they present challenges such as the one in the image.
They have done other versions similiar to this one, like "move sticks to solve this equation" or "remove sticks to solve".

This repository solves such challenges for numbers with up to 3 digits. It takes around 3 second to run in my personal computer on debug mode.

To run the code, install rust (see https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and run

`cargo run`

in the terminal.
